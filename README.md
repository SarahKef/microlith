Image simulation for microscopy and lithography systems
This MATLAB package provides accurate algorithms for simulation of images produced by coherent, incoherent (fluorescence), and partially coherent microscopy methods. Arial images projected by optical lithography systems can also be simulated.
Paper describing the choice of algorithms and their accuracy is here:
